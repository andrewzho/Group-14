## Summary of the Project
The **Minecraft AI Dungeon Master** project aims to create an intelligent system that generates dynamic and personalized quests within the Minecraft environment. Acting as a Dungeon Master (DM), the AI will analyze real-time player actions, preferences, and game state to craft immersive challenges and storylines. The system will take inputs such as the player's location, inventory, and playstyle (e.g., explorer, builder, or combat-focused) and produce outputs in the form of quests, puzzles, and game-world modifications (e.g., spawning structures or mobs). This project seeks to enhance player engagement, create unique gameplay experiences, and demonstrate the application of AI in creative and adaptive content generation.

## AI/ML Algorithms
We anticipate using the following methods and algorithms for this project:
- **Behavior Cloning**: To replicate patterns from expert Dungeon Masters.
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: A reinforcement learning method for generating dynamic, state-dependent quests.
- **Reward Shaping**: To fine-tune the quest generation process.
- Optionally, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** models for generating quest narratives.

## Evaluation Plan
### Quantitative Evaluation
We will evaluate the AI Dungeon Master based on:
1. **Player Engagement Metrics**: Measuring the average time spent on quests and their completion rates.
2. **Reward Signal Analysis**: Tracking how effectively the AI adapts to player actions and produces balanced challenges.

### Qualitative Evaluation
1. **Player Feedback**: Collect feedback on quest creativity, relevance, and difficulty through surveys or interviews.
2. **Visual Analysis**: Showcase quest progressions and analyze how the AI tailors content to different playstyles.
3. **Emergent Behavior**: Observe the variety of quests generated and highlight examples of innovative or unexpected game scenarios.

### Moonshot Case
The ultimate goal is for the AI to create quest experiences that are indistinguishable from those crafted by a skilled human Dungeon Master, with seamless adaptation to any player's style and preferences.

## Meet the Instructor
We plan to meet with the instructor no later than **Week 5** to discuss our progress and implementation strategy. Our suggested earliest meeting date is **[Insert Date]**, ensuring that all teammates can participate.

## AI Tool Usage
We will use the following tools:
- **OpenAI GPT API**: To generate natural language narratives for quests.
- **Stable-Baselines3 or RLlib**: To implement and train the reinforcement learning agent.
- **Minecraft Modding API**: For in-game integration and testing.

All AI tools used in this project will be documented, including their purpose and the specific tasks they support. We will ensure that the AI output is critically reviewed for quality and relevance.
