## Summary of the Project
The **Collaborative Obstacle Tower Solver Using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning** project aims to develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) system to solve procedurally generated puzzles in the Obstacle Tower environment. The environment challenges agents to navigate increasingly complex locomotion puzzles requiring coordination, planning, and adaptation. 

The system will take inputs such as the visual representation of the tower levels, agent states, and task-specific constraints. Outputs will include coordinated actions taken by multiple agents to progress through the tower efficiently. This project focuses on enabling agents to collaborate, generalize across unseen levels, and address challenges in multi-agent coordination and learning. Applications include training cooperative AI for dynamic problem-solving and generalizing solutions to real-world tasks requiring teamwork.

## AI/ML Algorithms
We anticipate using reinforcement learning with neural function approximators, specifically leveraging Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) methods. These algorithms will be model-free and primarily on-policy, enabling multi-agent collaboration and efficient policy learning in the Obstacle Tower environment.

## Evaluation Plan
### Quantitative Evaluation
1. **Success Rate**: Percentage of tower levels successfully completed by the agents.
2. **Efficiency Metrics**: Average steps required to complete each level.
3. **Reward Accumulation**: Total rewards earned by the agents per episode.

### Qualitative Evaluation
1. **Visualization**: Highlight how agents collaborate to solve puzzles and navigate obstacles.
2. **Emergent Behavior**: Observe the strategies and coordination dynamics developed by agents.
3. **Generalization**: Evaluate performance on unseen, procedurally generated levels.

### Moonshot Case
The moonshot goal is to develop agents capable of solving all levels of the Obstacle Tower environment while demonstrating highly efficient and human-like problem-solving capabilities.
